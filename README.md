# ML Journey

This repository showcases my machine learning journey — a collection of assignments and projects that reflect both core concepts and applied practice.  
It highlights the path I took from foundational algorithms to end-to-end implementations across real-world problem statements.

## Contents
- **core-ml-assignments.html** – Comprehensive assignment solutions covering core ML algorithms  
- **renewind-project.html** – Applied project analyzing the Renewind dataset  
- **end-to-end-workflows.html** – Complete ML pipelines with preprocessing, training, and evaluation  
- **easyvisa-project.html** – Capstone-style project: EasyVisa case study  

## Highlights
- Covers core ML algorithms: regression, classification, clustering, tree-based models  
- End-to-end workflows: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation  
- Applications inspired by real-world domains and case studies
